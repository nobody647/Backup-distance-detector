Display module:
	7-segment Display
	Waits for wakeup
	Displays recieved data
	ESP

Distance module:
	Ultrasonic distance module
		HC-SR04 + step up
		HC-SR04P
	ESP
	Battery




OPTION A:
	Distance and display both battery powered

	Distance module & display module start in deep sleep
	Distance module wakes every X seconds to check distance
	Display module wakes every X seconds to check for AP
	If distance < 5m
		Turn on AP
		Wait for display to wake and connect
		Stay awake and transmitting until distance > 5m

		***MAJOR PROBLEMO***: Both modules are active if car is parked and I'm gone. No bueno

Option B:
	Display is USB powered, distance is battery powered

	Display hosts a network
	Distance in deep sleep, wakes every X seconds to check distance
	If distance < 5m
		Connect to AP
		Transmit data until
		If distance > 5m for more than X seconds:
			Go back to deep sleep
		If display switch is OFF:
			Go to light sleep


OPTIONS:
	Deep sleep all the time
		Distance module in deep sleep, wakes every X seconds, connects to AP, if distance < 5m connects to AP. If display switch is OFF, goes back to sleep
		Pros:
			Simple
			Uses low current (if connecting to AP is fast)
		Cons:
			X second delay
			Uses high current (if connecting to AP is slow)
			Delay for connecting to AP
			Need USB power for display
			I dont' like it much

	Light sleep all the time
		Distance module in light sleep, if display switch is ON, display sends pings every X seconds
		Pros:
			Simple-ish
			Uses consistent current
			Doesn't waste power when not in Uses
			Allows easy modification of firmware
		Cons:
			Might use more current than deep sleep
			???

Options Pt 2:
	USB Power for display module
		The AP will always be running. The switch will toggle requests for distance
		Pros:
			Faster connection time
			Simpler
		Cons:
			Annoying
	
	Battery power for display module
		The AP will only be on when the switch is on.
		Pros:
			Less Annoying
		Cons:
			Might be slower
			Distance module has to check for AP to connect to


		Hey dummy, you can switch between these modes on the fly without messing with the distance module. The distance module doesn't care whether the AP is always up or not. 
		Have it try to connect periodically, and only send data when it recieves a request. This way, you can change the display from battery mode to USB mode without touching the distance module!
